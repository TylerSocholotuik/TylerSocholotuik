Hi, I'm Tyler Socholotuik.

I'm currently a first-year student of the Digital Media and IT - Software Development Concentration at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology in Edmonton, AB. I am thoroughly enjoying the program, and I achieved a 4.0 GPA in the first semester. 
I am hoping to obtain a Work-Integrated Learning (Co-op) position in spring 2024 to gain industry experience and kickstart my career.

### What I've learned so far

- C# Programming Fundamentals (arithmetic, decisions, loops, arrays, methods, classes and objects)
- SQL Database Fundamentals (normalization, DML, SPROCs, Triggers)
- Web Design Fundamentals (semantic HTML, CSS, responsive web design)
- (In progress) Client-Side JavaScript (event handling, functions, arrays, loops)
- (In progress) Systems Analysis - (ADEPT, Data Flow Diagrams)
- Communication (professional writing, presentations, research, team-work, meetings)

### Portfolio Projects

My academic work is in private repositories that I do no have permission to share, so I completed a personal project to demonstrate my skills.

#### loadLogic One-Rep Max Calculator

A respsonsive website that allows a user to enter the weight, repetitions, and RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) of a set they have performed in any resistance training exercise
and calculate their estimated one-rep max. It also displays a table showing the estimated amount of weight they can lift for a different number of repetitions and RPE ratings
(1-10 reps, RPE 6-10). It has a home page with and introduction and basic instructions for the calculator function, and an About RPE page with a short article and table explaining the concept of RPE.
