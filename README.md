### Portfolio Projects

#### loadLogic One-Rep Max Calculator

A responsive website that allows a user to enter the weight, repetitions, and RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) of a set they have performed in any resistance training exercise
and calculate their estimated one-rep max. It also displays a table showing the estimated amount of weight they can lift for a different number of repetitions and RPE ratings
(1-10 reps, RPE 6-10). It has a home page with an introduction and basic instructions for the calculator function, and an About RPE page with a short article and table explaining the concept of RPE.
